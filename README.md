# CANTILEVER

Welcome to the **CANTILEVER** repository! This repo contains two full-stack web applications built using the MERN stack which were assigned to me as part of my internship with Cantilever, each housed in its own directory with independent functionality, purpose, and README documentation.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. 🧩 Task Management Web App (`/Task-Management-Webapp`)

A robust and interactive task management system where users can create, track, and categorize their tasks into statuses like "Pending", "Running", "Completed", and "Failed". It includes authentication, task filtering, and an elegant UI.

### 2. 📝 Blog Website (`/Blog-Space`)

A fully-featured blog publishing platform where users can create and view posts. It uses Material UI for styling, MongoDB with Multer for image uploads, and JSON Web Tokens for authentication. Ideal for writers and readers.
